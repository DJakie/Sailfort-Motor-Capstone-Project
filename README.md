# Sailfort-Motor-Capstone-Project
### Summary of Steps in the Capstone Project

Based on the extracted markdown content, here is a summarized workflow for your capstone project:

1. **Data Understanding**:
   - The dataset was loaded and inspected to understand its structure and content.
   - Initial exploration was conducted to identify key variables and any missing data.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning steps to handle missing values and outliers.
   - Feature engineering to create relevant variables for modeling.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze patterns and distributions.
   - Insights into factors influencing employee attrition were explored.

4. **Model Development**:
   - Statiscal models(Logistic Regression) and Machine learning models ( Decision Trees, Random Forests) were trained to predict employee attrition.
   - Model evaluation metrics like accuracy, recall, F1-Score, precision. confusion matrix and ROC-AUC were computed to assess performance.

6. **Insights and Interpretations**:
   - Model results were interpreted to provide actionable recommendations for the HR department.
   - Random forest had the best metric for this case and hence was selected.

7. **Final Deliverables**:
   - Reccomendations to improve employee retention was given based on feature importance received from Random Forest model.
